Program I played around with for Vex Tower Takeover

# GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
LVGL was used for creating an autonomous selector. Demo video:

# COMPILATION
This program takes about 15 seconds to compile due to bloated stuff so to speed it it up, use GNU Make with the flag "-j 10" to decrease compile speed through parallel compilation.

# REMINDER
I only use this program to test out different things so it is extremely messy and not optimized so I would advise to use this program only as a reference.

For the vision sensor, it's better to declare the color signature in the header file. I got lazy and didn't do it yet so most likely the code for the vision sensor will mot work
