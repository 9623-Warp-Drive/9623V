# GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
LVGL was used for creating an autonomous selector. Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ntxXrUGNo

If you are using VexCode, you can add LVGL to your project by following the directions here: https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl#add-littlevgl-to-your-project

Example LVGL project format in VexCode: https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-lvgllib6_2

# PORT
| Subsystem | Left Motor | Right Motor |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Chassis | 10 | 1 |
| Intake | 9 | 2 |
| Lift | 20 | 13 |
| Tray | 15 | 16 |

# KEYBINDING
Drive Chassis = Split Arcade  

R1 = Intake Out  
R2 = Intake In  

L1 = Lift Up  
L2 = Lift Down  

X = Tray Up  
B = Tray Down

# CONTROLLER LAYOUT SWITCHER
| Number  | Layout |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0  | Autonmous Recorder  |
| 1  | Autonmous Related  |
| 2  | Macro  |

Prefix A + Down Arrow = Switch Layout

AUTONOMOUS RECORDER:  
Prefix Y + Down Arrow = Switch Subsystem  
Prefix Y + Left Arrow = Recorder Checkpoint  
Prefix Y + Up Arrow = Print/Preview Recorded Value  
Prefix Y + Right Arrow = Clear All Recorded Value  

AUTONOMOUS RELATED:  
Prefix Y + Down Arrow = Switch Autonomous Routines  
Prefix Y + Right Arrow = Run Autonomous  

MACRO:  
Prefix Y + Up Arrow = Stack Macro  
Prefix Y + Left Arrow = Raise Lift to Medium Height  
Prefix Y + Right Arrow = Raise Lift to Max Heigt

# REMINDER
I created project to test out different functionality so the project is kind of messy and not optimized. Please not try to copy everything in the project. Feel free to contribute or fork this repo. Thank you!
