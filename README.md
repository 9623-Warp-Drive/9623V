# GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
LVGL was used for creating an autonomous selector. Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ntxXrUGNo

If you are using VexCode, you can add LVGL to your project by following the directions here: https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl#add-littlevgl-to-your-project

Example LVGL project format in VexCode: https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-lvgllib6_2

# KEYBINDING

Autonomous Recorder Binding:  
Default Prefix = Y  
Prefix + Down Arrow = Change Subsystem  
Prefix + Left Arrow = Record Checkpoint  
Prefix + Right Arrow = Run Autonomous  
Prefix + Up Arrow = Print recorded value in motor degree  

Drive Binding:  
Default Prefix = A  
Prefix + Down Arrow = Switch Autonomous Routines  
Prefix + Up Arrow = Tilter Macro  
X = Tilter Up  
B = Tilter Down  
Prefix + R1 = Tilter Up  
Prefix + R2 = Tilter Down  
R1 = Intake Out  
R2 = Intake In  
L2 = Lift Down  
L1 = Lift Up  
Prefix + L2 = Async Lift and Tilter Down  
Prefix + L1 = Async Lift and Tilter Up  
Prefix + Left Arrow = Move Lift to Medium Height  
Prefix + Right Arrow = Move Lift to Max Height  

# REMINDER
I created project to test out different functionality so the project is kind of messy and not optimized. Please not try to copy everything in the project. Feel free to contribute or fork this repo. Thank you!
