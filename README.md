# AUTONOMOUS SELECTOR

## CORTEX

LVGL (https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl) was used to create the graphical interface on the cortex.

> Make sure to select autonomous routine before plugging the controller into the tower

## SETUP LVGL IN VEXCODE

To add LVGL library to your porject, follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl#add-littlevgl-to-your-project)

# DISCLAIMER

I created project to test out different functionality so the project is kind of messy and not optimized. In addition, some functionality might be broken as well. Please not try to copy everything in the project. Feel free to contribute or fork this repo. Thank you!
