# GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
LVGL was used for creating an autonomous selector. Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ntxXrUGNo

If you are using VexCode, you can add LVGL to your project by following the directions here: https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl#add-littlevgl-to-your-project

Example LVGL project format in VexCode: https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-lvgllib6_2

# KEYBINDING

Autonomous Recorder Binding:
Prefix is mapped to Y
Hold Prefix = Display Current Subsystem
Prefix + Down Arrow = Change Subsystem
Prefix + Left Arrow = Record Checkpoint
Prefix + Right Arrow = Run Autonomous
Prefix + Up Arrow = Run Autonomous Recorder Function

Drive Binding:
Hold A while moving joystick to move slower

# REMINDER
I created project to test out different functionality so the project is kind of messy and not optimized. Please not try to copy everything in the project. Feel free to contribute or fork this repo. Thank you!
